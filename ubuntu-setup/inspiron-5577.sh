# setup script for my Insporon 5577 laptop
# prior to using this, I could not get pas the sign in screen due to Nvidia graphic drivers.
# at sign-in screen, I used CTRL-F2 to get command line then:

# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
# ubuntu-drivers-list
# I was only able to get the 390 to load
# sudo apt-install nvidia-driver-390
# reboot (it froze when rebooting, had to hard reset)
# No I could log in normally
# Installed git so I could clone my script from github
# sudo apt install git
